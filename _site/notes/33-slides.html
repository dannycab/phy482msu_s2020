Two major results of special relativity are Time Dilation and Lorentz Contraction. Please pick one of the choices below which best describes how well you feel you understand them.

1. No idea what these effects are
2. I remember having heard about these, but couldn't define them precisely right now.
3. I know what these effects are, (but I've forgotten how to derive them)
4. I know what these effects are, and I even sort of remember the derivation, but it would take me a while to sort it out
5. I'm confident I could derive these results right now

You are standing next to a conveyer belt that is transporting a baby (don't ask questions) at 1 m/s **to the right**. The baby is crawling at **2 m/s to the right**. What is the velocity of the baby in your frame?

1. 1 m/s to the left
2. 1 m/s to the right
3. 3 m/s to the right
4. 3 m/s to the left
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: C

Standing on a moving walkway in the airport that is moving at 1 m/s to the right, you toss a ball into the air. You observe the ball moving straight up and down.

I'm sitting on a bench watching your shenanigans. What do I have to do to make my physics match yours? That is, what do I have to do to reproduce all your measurements?

1. Add 1 m/s to the left
2. Add 1 m/s to the right
3. Subtract 1 m/s to the right
4. Subtract 1 m/s to the left
5. None or more than one of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: E (it's A and C)

A rocket is moving to the right at speed $v = (3/4)c$, relative to Earth.  On the  front of the rocket is a headlight which emits a flash of light.

&lt;img src="./images/rocket_light.png" align="center" style="width: 700px";/&gt;

In the reference frame of a passenger on the rocket, the speed of the light flash is

1. $c$
2. 7/4 $c$
3. 1/4 $c$
4. None of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

According to a person at rest on the earth, the speed of the light flash is

1. $c$
2. 7/4 $c$
3. 1/4 $c$
4. None of these

&lt;img src="./images/rocket_light.png" align="center" style="width: 700px";/&gt;

According to a person moving toward the rocket at speed $(3/4)c$, relative to earth, the speed of the light flash is

1. $c$
2. 7/4 $c$
3. 1/4 $c$
4. None of these
