## Changes to Syllabus
* Pair project is cancelled. One additional homework problem per week.
* Homework: 40% -&gt; 50%
* Individual Project: 20% -&gt; 25%
* Quizzes: 20% -&gt; 25%

Will still drop one homework assignment and quiz.

I will take into account the wildly-extenuated circumstances when assigning letter grades.

Standing on a moving walkway in the airport that is moving at 1 m/s to the right, you toss a ball into the air. You observe the ball moving straight up and down.

I'm sitting on a bench watching your shenanigans. What do I have to do to make my physics match yours? That is, what do I have to do to reproduce all your measurements?

1. Add 1 m/s to the left
2. Add 1 m/s to the right
3. Subtract 1 m/s to the right
4. Subtract 1 m/s to the left
5. None or more than one of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: E (it's A and C)

<section data-markdown="">

A rocket is moving to the right at speed $v = (3/4)c$, relative to Earth.  On the  front of the rocket is a headlight which emits a flash of light.

&lt;img src="./images/rocket_light.png" align="center" style="width: 700px";/&gt;

In the reference frame of a passenger on the rocket, the speed of the light flash is

1. $c$
2. 7/4 $c$
3. 1/4 $c$
4. None of these

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

&lt;img src="./images/rocket_light.png" align="center" style="width: 700px";/&gt;

According to a person moving toward the rocket at speed $(3/4)c$, relative to earth, the speed of the light flash is

1. $c$
2. 7/4 $c$
3. 1/4 $c$
4. None of these

Note:

<section data-markdown="">

Consider a $S'$ frame moving with a speed $v$ in 1D with respect to a stationary frame $S$. Using your everyday intuition, write down the relationship between a position measurement $x$ and $x'$.

*Be ready to explain why this makes sense to you.*

Note:
This is just to get them thinking about the Galilean transformation again as you will do this with gamma.

</section>

<section data-markdown="">

The Galilean transformation between $S'$ and $S$ is:

$$x = x' + vt$$

The Lorentz transformation will introduce a $\gamma$, where do you think it goes? And why?

Note:
This is just to get them thinking. The time will dilate and the length with contract, so where does the gamma go? It ultimately multiples both.

<section data-markdown="">

I'm in frame $S$, and you are in is in Frame $S'$, which moves with speed $V$ in the $+x$ direction.

An object moves in the $S'$ frame in the $+x$ direction with speed $v'_x$.
Do I measure its $x$ component of velocity to be $v_x = v'_x$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* can't be. because of time dilation and length contraction

An object moves in the $S'$ frame in the $+y$ direction with speed $v'_y$.
Do I measure its $y$ component of velocity to be $v_y = v'_y$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* again. can't be. because of time dilation and length contraction

<section data-markdown="">

With Einstein's velocity addition rule,

$$u = \dfrac{u' + v}{1+\frac{u'v}{c^2}}$$

what happens when $v$ is very small compared to $c$?

1. $u\rightarrow 0$
2. $u\rightarrow c$
3. $u\rightarrow \infty$
4. $u \approx u' + v$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: D
* denominator goes to 1 because second term is near zero - get back classical addition
</section>

<section data-markdown="">

With Einstein's velocity addition rule,

$$u = \dfrac{u' + v}{1+\frac{u'v}{c^2}}$$

what happens when $u'$ is $c$?

1. $u\rightarrow 0$
2. $u\rightarrow c$
3. $u\rightarrow \infty$
4. $u \approx u' + v$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* plug it in and you will get c; if something moves with c it does so in every frame - constant speed of light
