I have seen the Eisntein summation notation before:

$$\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} \equiv a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$$

1. Yes and I'm comfortable with it
2. Yes, but I'm just a little rusty with it
3. Yes, but I don't remember it it all
3. Nope

**True or False:** The dot product (in 3 space) is invariant to rotations.

$$\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} \equiv a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$$

1. True
2. False
3. No idea

Note:
* Correct answer: A (when Galilean relativity is ok)

Displacement is a defined quantity

$$\Delta x^{\mu} \equiv \left(x^{\mu}_A - x^{\mu}_B\right)$$

Is the displacement a contravariant 4-vector?

1. Yes
2. No
3. Umm...don't know how to tell
4. None of these.

**Be ready to explain your answer.**

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

The displacement between two events $\Delta x^{\mu}$ is a contravariant 4-vector.

Is $5 \Delta x^{\mu}$ also a 4-vector?

1. Yes
2. No

The displacement between two events $\Delta x^{\mu}$ is a contravariant 4-vector.

Is $\Delta x^{\mu}/\Delta t$ also a 4-vector (where $\Delta t$ is the time between in events in some frame)?

1. Yes
2. No

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
