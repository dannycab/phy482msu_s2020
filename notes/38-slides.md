Two events have a timelike separation. In a "1+1"-dimensional spacetime (Minkowski) diagram (x horizontal, ct vertical), the magnitude of the slope of a line connecting the two events is

1. Greater than 1
2. Equal to 1
3. Less than 1

Note:
* Correct Answer: A

Consider the world line of an object drawn on a Minkowski (space-time) diagram. At any point in that space, the slope of that line is:

1. larger than 1
2. less than 1
3. able to take on any value

Note:
* Correct answer: A

Points that lie outside the light cone for a given event are:

1. accessible no matter where they are
2. accessible for given world lines (trajectories)
3. always inaccessible

Note:
* Correct answer: C
