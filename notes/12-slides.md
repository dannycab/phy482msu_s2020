## Announcements
* Project problems are graded
  * Sync your repositories to receive feedback
  * Responding to your feedback is a big part of the next project problem
* Quiz 3 (next Friday 2/17) - RLC circuits
  * Solve a circuit problem using the phasor method
  * Discuss limits on the response and how it might act as a filter

For the RL circuit with driving voltage of $V(t) = V_0 \cos (\omega t)$, we found a solution for the current as a function of time, with $I=0$ at $t=0$,

$$I(t) = a \cos(\omega t + \phi) - a\cos(\phi) e^{-Rt/L}$$

where $a = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{R^2+L^2\omega^2}}$ and $\phi = \tan^{-1}(-L\omega/R)$. What happens to the current when $\omega \rightarrow \infty$?

1. Current is essentially zero, for all time
2. Current dies off completely, eventually goes to zero
3. Eventually, current is constant, $V_0/R$
4. It depends
5. ???
