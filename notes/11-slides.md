Loop 1 sits in a uniform field B which is increasing in magnitude. Loop 2 has the SAME LENGTH OF WIRE looped (coiled) to make two (smaller) loops.
How do the induced EMFs compare?


1. EMF(1)=4 EMF(2)
2. EMF(1) = 2 EMF(2)
3. They are both the same.
4. EMF(2)= 4 EMF(1)
5. EMF(2) = 2 EMF(1)

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* Reduce A by 4, Loops up by 2

The complex exponential: $e^{i\omega t}$ is useful in calculating properties of many time-dependent equations. According to Euler, we can also write this function as:

1. $\cos(i \omega t) + \sin (i \omega t)$
2. $\sin (\omega t) + i \cos(\omega t)$
3. $\cos(\omega t) + i \sin (\omega t)$
4. MORE than one of these is correct
5. None of these is correct!

Note:
* Correct Answer: C
