In matter we have,

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho_f \qquad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$
$$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \qquad \nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J}_f + \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t}$$
with
$$\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} \qquad \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{B}/\mu_0 - \mathbf{M}$$

If there are no free charges or current, is $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$?

1. Yes, always
2. Yes, under certain conditions (what are they?)
3. No, in general this will not be true
4. ??

Note:
* Correct answer: B

In linear dielectrics, $\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} = \varepsilon \mathbf{E}.$ In a linear dielectric is $\varepsilon > \varepsilon_0$?

1. Yes, always
2. No, never
3. Sometimes, it depends on the details of the dielectric.

Note:
* Correct answer: A

In a non-magnetic, linear dielectric,

$$v = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \varepsilon}} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \varepsilon_r \varepsilon_0}} = \dfrac{c}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_r}}$$

How does $v$ compare to $c$?

1. $v>c$ always
2. $v<c$ always
3. It depends

Note:
* Correct Answer: B

In our analogy of waves on strings to E&M waves, we said that that a light string corresponded to a (fast, slow) EM media and a heavy string corresponded to a (fast, slow) EM media.

1. fast; slow
2. slow; fast
3. slow; slow
4. fast; fast

For our reflected and transmitted waves, how many unknowns have we introduced?

$$\mathbf{E}_R = \widetilde{E_R}e^{i(k_Rz-\omega_Rt)}\hat{n}_R$$
$$\mathbf{E}_T = \widetilde{E_T}e^{i(k_Tz-\omega_Tt)}\hat{n}_T$$

1. 2
2. 4
3. 8
4. 12
5. None of the above

Note:
* Correct answer: D
* It's about 12.

An EM wave is normally incident on a boundary between two materials ($n_1 \ll n_2$). If the incident wave starts in **material 1**,

1. most of the wave is reflected back; very little of the wave transmits through material 2
2. some of the wave is reflected back; some of the wave transmits through material 2
3. very little of the wave is reflected back; most of the wave transmits through material 2
4. ???
