The Galilean transformation between $S'$ and $S$ is:

$$x = x' + vt$$

The Lorentz transformation will introduce a $\gamma$, where do you think it goes? And why?

Note:
This is just to get them thinking. The time will dilate and the length with contract, so where does the gamma go? It ultimately multiples both.

I'm in frame $S$, and you are in is in Frame $S'$, which moves with speed $V$ in the $+x$ direction.

An object moves in the $S'$ frame in the $+x$ direction with speed $v'_x$.
Do I measure its $x$ component of velocity to be $v_x = v'_x$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* can't be. because of time dilation and length contraction

I'm in frame $S$, and you are in is in Frame $S'$, which moves with speed $V$ in the $+x$ direction.

An object moves in the $S'$ frame in the $+y$ direction with speed $v'_y$.
Do I measure its $y$ component of velocity to be $v_y = v'_y$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. ???

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* again. can't be. because of time dilation and length contraction
