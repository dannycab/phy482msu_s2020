1. most of the wave is reflected back; very little of the wave transmits through the light string
2. some of the wave is reflected back; some of the wave transmits through light string
3. very little of the wave is reflected back; most of the wave transmits through light string
4. ???

Note:

**Claim:** For a wave heading towards a boundary between two media at an oblique angle, at the boundary, $\mathbf{k}_I\cdot\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{k}_R\cdot\mathbf{r} \neq \mathbf{k}_T\cdot\mathbf{r}$.

1. True
2. False

Note:
* Correct Answer: B
* All are equal
